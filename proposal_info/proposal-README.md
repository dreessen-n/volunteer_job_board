# Volunteer Job Board

## Proposal by David Gonzales and Neal Dreessen

For our group project, David suggested a chores job board. I was excited by the prospect
becuase I work for a non-profit and we do volunteer job signup all the time. I
suggested we alter the project to be for volunteer jobs, rather than chores, and he agreed. 

## App description:

The App will be a site for people to look for and create volunteer jobs.

People will have to register to see the site.

Users can create volunteer jobs.

Users can signup for volunteer jobs.

Users info will not show on the job description unless they are the organizer
of the volunteer job. This is for privacy. Only users first name will show.
