# Volunteer Job Board

## Proposal by David Gonzales and Neal Dreessen

For our group project, David suggested a chores job board. I was excited by the prospect
becuase I work for a non-profit and we do volunteer job signup all the time. I
suggested we alter the project to be for volunteer jobs, rather than chores, and he agreed.
