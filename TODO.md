# TODO list:

1. Phone number: not validated; opitonal at this point. Not sure about null in
database. Also do we want to format the phone number coming in?

2. Populating the date, start_time and end_time on the edit page. No working right.
Also need to figure out styling the input and display of both

~~3. Need to have the status say open on the show page if job not filled with volunteers
And closed if enought users have signed up.~~ This can be styled but
functionality is there.

~~4. The signup button show display if volunteers are needed or disappear and a label 
show for when enough volunteers are signed up.~~ This can be styled but
functionality is there.

5. Need logic to not display closed (enough volunteers signed up) jobs on dashboard.
But if someone takes them selves off the list, the job should open again.
